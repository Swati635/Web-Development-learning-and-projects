    <!-- <h1>What is HTML & why is it used?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used to create and structure the content of a webpage.</p>
    <p><b>HyperText:</b> This refers to the ability to create links that connect web pages to one another, making the web a connected "web" of information.</p>
    <p> <b>Markup Language:</b> This means you use "tags" to surround your content, giving that content meaning and structure. You are "marking up" a plain text document.</p> -->
